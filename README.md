# Milestone1

Milestone Project 1 from 2020 Complete Python Bootcamp on Udemy.

Things I learned:
- Variable naming is really important. There was a lot of confusion as the code increased in size as to what each variable held and what I should be using in the functions.
- The difference between = and == is one I understand in theory but one that I forget constantly in every if statement
- It would be very useful to define test conditions beforehand
